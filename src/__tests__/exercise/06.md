# mocking modules

## Background

Mocking HTTP requests is one thing, but sometimes you have entire modules that
you need to mock. Every time you create a fake version of what your code
actually uses, you're "poking a hole in reality" and you lose some confidence as
a result (which is why E2E tests are critical). Remember, we're doing it and
recognizing that we're trading confidence for some practicality or convenience
in our testing. (Read more about this in my blog post:
[The Merits of Mocking](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-merits-of-mocking)).

To learn more about what "mocking" even is, take a look at my blog post
[But really, what is a JavaScript mock?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-mock)

Jest makes it relatively simple to mock a module:

```javascript
// math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b

// __tests__/some-test.js
import {add, subtract} from '../math'

jest.mock('../math')

// now all the function exports from the "math.js" module are jest mock functions
// so we can call .mockImplementation(...) on them
// and make assertions like .toHaveBeenCalledTimes(...)
```

Additionally, if you'd like to mock only _parts_ of a module, you can provide
your own "mock module getter" function:

```javascript
jest.mock('../math', () => {
  const actualMath = jest.requireActual('../math')
  return {
    ...actualMath,
    subtract: jest.fn(),
  }
})

// now the `add` export is the normal function,
// but the `subtract` export is a mock function.
```

To learn a bit about how this works, take a look at my repo
[how-jest-mocking-works](https://github.com/kentcdodds/how-jest-mocking-works).
It's pretty fascinating.

There's a lot more to learn about the things you can do with Jest's module
mocking capabilities. You can also read the docs about this here:

## Exercise

In this exercise we're going to continue our same test as the last exercise but
now we want to navigate the user to the `/app` route. We're using React Router's
`useNavigate` hook to get a `navigate` function which we'll use inside a
`useEffect` callback. We're also setting the user's token in `localStorage`, so
in addition to verifying that `navigate` is called properly, we also want to
make sure that `localStorage` is set correctly as well.
